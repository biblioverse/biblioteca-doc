## Welcome to Biblioteca
Welcome to the official Biblioteca Documentation page! Here you will find all the information you need to get started with

## What is Biblioteca?
Biblioteca is a web application created to manage your personal library. This is an alternative to Calibre and other similar

solutions, so I decided to make my own.
