## First user
You should have created your first admin user after installing the app. The first user is always an admin and you will need 
admin rights to add other users

## Adding new users
If you are logged in with an administrator account, you will have a link to the user management page `/user`.

Here you can add new users, change their roles, and set or change their passwords.

## Roles
User can have one of the following roles:
- `ROLE_USER`: The default role for new users. They can read books, change their own settings, create their own shelves and sync their Kobo devices.
- `ROLE_ADMIN`: Can do everything a user can do and manage users and books.
