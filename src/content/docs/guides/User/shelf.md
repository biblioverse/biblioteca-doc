title: Simple shelves

Shelves are groups of books, they can be static or dynamic.

You can manually add books to static shelves and that's it.

You can also create dynamic shelves, which are based on a query. For example, you can create a shelf that contains all
books from your favorite authors that you haven't read and if you or an administrator adds books from these authors,
they will automatically be listed in there.
