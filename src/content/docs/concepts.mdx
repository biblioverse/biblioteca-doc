There are a few important concepts here, if this is your first read, take some time to make sure we have the same definitions
for them.
## Books
Books can be of multiple formats, but for now every book only has one format. Supported formats are epub, pdf, mobi, cbr, and cbz.

## Shelves
Shelves are groups of books, they can be static or dynamic.

You can manually add books to static shelves and that's it.

You can also create dynamic shelves, which are based on a query. For example, you can create a shelf that contains all
books from your favorite authors that you haven't read and if you or an administrator adds books from these authors,
they will automatically be listed in there.

<CardGrid>
    <LinkCard title="Static Shelves" href="managing_books/shelves/shelf" />
    <LinkCard title="Dynamic Shelves" href="managing_books/shelves/dynamic" />
</CardGrid>

## File system structure and Relocation

You can manage the file structure of your book by hand and run a command to have them in biblioteca, or you can ask biblioteca
to relocate them to a path format of your choice.
